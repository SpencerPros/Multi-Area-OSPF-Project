# Multi-Area-OSPF-Project

This repository contains the configuration files and documentation I used for a multi-area OSPF network project I created using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Project Overview

In this project, I wanted to get a sense of what a real world scenario would look like when seeting up Multi-Area OSPF on a network. So I designed and implemented a network using OSPF with multiple areas to demonstrate efficient routing and network segmentation this network consists of PC's, routers, and switches interconnected to simulate a real-world scenario.

## Features

- **Network Topology:** Detailed network diagram and description of the topology used in the project.
- **Configuration Files:** Configuration files for routers and switches in each OSPF area.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation explaining the project objectives, design decisions, and implementation steps.
- **Testing and Validation:** Methods used to test and validate the network configuration, including packet captures and routing table analysis.

## Project Goals

- Understand the fundamentals of OSPF routing protocol and its advantages in large-scale networks.
- Practice network segmentation and routing optimization using OSPF areas.
- Gain hands-on experience with Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation and configuration.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Requirements:** Ensure you have Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your system.
2. **Clone Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/multi-area-ospf-network.git`.
3. **Import Project:** Open the project file in Cisco Packet Tracer and import the configurations provided.
4. **Simulate and Test:** Simulate the network and validate OSPF functionality across different areas.
5. **Explore Documentation:** Refer to the documentation folder for detailed setup instructions, network diagrams, and configuration explanations.

## Future Enhancements

- Expand the network by adding more OSPF areas or integrating additional networking protocols.
- Implement security measures such as Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to enhance network protection.
- Integrate real-world scenarios and traffic patterns for more realistic simulation and testing.
